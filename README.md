### PGUARD Formal Verification

This repository contains the Tamarin models for our PGUARD implementation. Filenames ending in `_PROOFS` include the tamarin proofs.

*Note:* There appears to be a bug in Tamarin's proof download functionality. Therefore `_PROOFS` files must be manualy loaded using the "Loading a new theory" functionality in tamarin. Additionaly, some proofs indicate invalid proof steps when loaded. This can resolved by deleting the last proof step and reinvoking the autoprover.
